        All modern websites and web applications are built using three
        <b><em>fundamental</em></b>
        technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
        web.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.
      </p>

      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext
        <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
        language that web developers use to structure and describe the content
        of a webpage (not a programming language).
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
        paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
        HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <p>
          These are the <strong>3</strong> steps we should follow while writing
          the HTML
        </p>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>

      <p>

      <h3>Why should we learn HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
        web.
      </p>
      <p>Here are <strong>5</strong> of them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language.</li>
        <li>
          To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
          Worpress or Wix.
        </li>
        <li>To build web applications.</li>
        <li>To impress girls.</li>
        <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ.</li>
        <p>
          Hopefully you have learned a few things in HTML. See you in next time.
